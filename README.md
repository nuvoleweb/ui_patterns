# UI Patterns 2.x

Define and expose self-contained UI Components as Drupal plugins and use them seamlessly in Drupal development and site-building.

Also called "components", UI patterns are reusable, nestable, guided by clear standards, and can be assembled together to build any number of applications. Examples: card, button, slider, pager, menu, toast...

The UI Patterns module also integrates with with tools like [PatternLab](http://patternlab.io/)
or modules like [Component Libraries](https://www.drupal.org/project/components)
thanks to [definition overrides](https://www.drupal.org/docs/contributed-modules/ui-patterns/define-your-patterns#s-override-patterns-behavior).

## Project overview

The UI Patterns project provides 5 modules:

- **UI Patterns**: the main module, based on Drupal Core SDC API, with additional powerful API and quality-of-life improvments
- **UI Patterns Library**: generates a pattern library page available at `/patterns`
  to be used as documentation for content editors or as a showcase for business. Use this module if you don't plan to
  use more advanced component library systems such as Storybook, PatternLab or Fractal.

- **UI Patterns Layouts**: allows to use patterns as layouts. This allows patterns to be used with Layout Builder,
  [Display Suite](https://www.drupal.org/project/ds) or [Panels](https://www.drupal.org/project/panels)
  out of the box. [Learn more](https://www.drupal.org/docs/contributed-modules/ui-patterns/use-patterns-as-layouts)
- **UI Patterns Views**: allows to use patterns as Views styles or Views rows.
