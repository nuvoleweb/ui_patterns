# UI Patterns Library

The UI Patterns Library module allows developers to expose patterns via YAML
definitions and to display them via a pattern library page to be used as
documentation for content editors or as a showcase for business, available at
`/patterns`.

For more information please refer to the [official documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/contributed-modules/ui-patterns).
