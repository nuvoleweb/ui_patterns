progress:
  label: "Progress (Legacy)"
  description: "The progress element displays an indicator showing the completion progress of a task, typically in the form of a bar. Progress components are built with two HTML elements, some CSS to set the width, and a few attributes. Bootstrap does not use the HTML5 <progress> element, ensuring you can stack progress bars, animate them, and place text labels over them."
